# Continuous capture

Applying the skill during normal, ongoing development.

## What's worth capturing

Not everything discussed in a session is worth writing down. Capture when the conversation contains:

- a decision between real alternatives, where the alternatives aren't obvious from the code alone
- a workaround for something external (a library bug, a platform limitation, a compatibility requirement)
- a constraint that comes from outside the code (legal, operational, business, a partner's API behavior)
- an incident or bug and what changed because of it
- something that looks like it could be simplified or removed, but shouldn't be, and why

Don't capture:

- routine implementation detail that the code already explains clearly
- decisions that are genuinely still open/undecided — note them as unknown or open instead of writing them up as settled
- anything speculative ("we might want to X later") unless it's actively shaping a decision made now

## The abandoned change is its own signal

Not every capture-worthy moment ends with a code change. Starting to modify or remove something, then stopping once a subtle reason not to becomes clear — a hidden dependency, a workaround that looked unnecessary but wasn't — is often exactly the moment worth recording, precisely because nothing else will: no diff, no commit, no PR ever points back to reasoning that stopped a change before it happened. Without capturing it here, that insight has to be painfully rediscovered next time, which is the whole Chesterton's Fence problem repeating itself.

Capture it the same way as a completed decision: what was about to change, what stopped it, and why — even though the code itself ends up looking untouched.

## When to write, during a session

Write the update at the point the rationale becomes clear — usually right after a decision is made or a workaround is explained, not batched up at the end of a long session where detail gets lost. If a topic file for the relevant subject already exists, update it in place rather than waiting to create a new one.

This means a natural checkpoint — a decision has actually landed — not every intermediate step on the way there. Collect what's worth capturing as the work happens, but write it up at the point the reasoning is settled; don't interrupt an in-progress implementation to document a choice that might still change.

## Updating vs. creating

Before creating a new topic file, check whether the subject already has one. A new decision about sync behavior belongs in the existing `sync.md`, appended or amended, not in a new `sync-2.md` or `new-sync-decision.md`. Fragmentation defeats the purpose — the whole point is that the next reader finds everything about a topic in one place.

## Keeping it low-effort

This mode is meant to be close to free for the person doing the work — the rationale was going to be discussed anyway; this just means it gets written down instead of evaporating with the session. If capturing something starts to feel like a large, separate task, that's a signal to write less, not to skip capturing entirely — a two-line note beats no note, and can be expanded later if it turns out to matter.

"Low-effort" doesn't mean "never ask." When it's genuinely unclear whether something is worth capturing, or how much of the reasoning actually belongs in the entry, a quick yes/no question costs the developer a few seconds — silently guessing (in either direction) costs more later, either as invented rationale or as a gap nobody knew to fill. A short confirmation check is exactly as low-friction as staying quiet; only long, multi-part interrogations aren't.

This is exactly what `capture-confirmation: confirm-when-unsure` names (see `setup.md`) — the project default, and what this section has been describing all along. `automatic` skips the permission question once Evidence and proportionality are already clear; `confirm-always` asks even here. Either way, a substantive question about the facts themselves (not permission to write) is always fair game, independent of the setting — see "Permission vs. clarification" in `setup.md`.
